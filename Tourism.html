        <h1>Blue Hole</h1>
        <p>The fall of a "guilty" shepherd from heaven was the reason for the formation of a deep blue hole painted by nature in the heart of the Red Sea, creating the most beautiful landscape you can see in your life.

The Blue Hole, located in the city of Dahab, has become a destination for local and foreign tourists who have organized regular visits to the place for diving.

The Blue Hole is no longer the only destination for foreign diving enthusiasts but has attracted the attention of Egyptians, and they only have to wear diving suits to explore coral reefs and dive into nature.

Among them were students from Ain Shams University's Faculty of Medicine who called themselves "Layons" after they decided to explore Egypt's undiscovered tourist attractions.

"The seventh day" said that his friends Ahmad Thabet, Mahmoud Salah and Mahmoud al-Saghir studied at the medical school, but they love to go on trips regularly and discovered a new place that is not known to many Egyptians. Here came the idea of ​​organizing excursions as the best place in the world for coral reefs, colorful fish and pure water.

Blue Hole tours take only 36 hours for young people to explore the place, dive or swim, and see rare fish and coral reefs.

The founder of the team pointed out that the purpose of the Blue Hole flights is to make diving tourism an internal tourism for the Egyptians themselves within their country. "We have places in Egypt a million times better than you travel Turkey or France to see landscapes."

"This is not the only place where the Lions team organizes trips to it, but there are also places like: Nelson Island in Alexandria, Tiran Island, Ras Mohammed Governorate in Sharm El Sheikh, Siwa, Wadi El Rayyan, Jabal Musa in St. Catherine, Luxor and Aswan. Internal before foreign ". </p>
